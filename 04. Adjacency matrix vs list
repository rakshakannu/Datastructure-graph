// list
most of the real world graphs are sparse graphs hence list is preferred

memory - v+e
check if there is an edge between u and v - v
finding all adjacent of a vertex - degree of vertex/ out degree of vertex
adding an edge - 1
removing an edge - v


// graph

memory - v*v
check if there is an edge between u and v - 1
finding all adjacent of a vertex - v
adding an edge - 1
removing an edge - 1
