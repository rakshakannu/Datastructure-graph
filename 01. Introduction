// we have seen linear(array, linkedlist) and non linear datastructures(tree)
// trees are used to represent heirarchy
// graph data structure allows connection from one node to any node
// a graph is represented by a pair of sets
// first set is a set of vertices
// other set is a set of edges

// there can be directed as well as undirected graphs
// real example of undirected graph is a social network
